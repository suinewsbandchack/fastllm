If you are using Rack2-Filer V5.0, you may want to download and install the latest update pack, which is Rack2-Filer V5.0 Update Pack 2 (V5.0L31). This update pack fixes some issues that occur only with MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 7, such as color inversion, file insertion, and delayed response[^1^]. It also improves the scanning performance using a FUJITSU fi series scanner with TWAIN driver[^1^].
 
To download and install Rack2-Filer V5.0 Update Pack 2, you need to have an Internet connection and administrator privileges on your Windows system. You can follow these steps:
