# How to Play Championship Manager 00/01 Without CD
 
Championship Manager 00/01 is a classic soccer management game that was released in 2000 by Eidos Interactive. The game lets you take control of your favorite team and lead them to glory in various leagues and competitions. However, if you want to play the game on a modern PC, you might encounter some problems with the CD protection. The game requires you to insert the original CD every time you want to play, which can be inconvenient or impossible if you don't have a CD drive or a working disc.

Fortunately, there are some ways to play Championship Manager 00/01 without CD. One of them is to use a no-CD patch that removes the CD-check from the game executable. A no-CD patch is a small file that modifies the game code to bypass the CD verification. There are different versions of no-CD patches for different updates of the game, so you need to make sure you have the right one for your game version. You can find some no-CD patches on websites like GameCopyWorld[^1^] or MegaGames[^3^]. To use a no-CD patch, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Install the game from the original CD or a digital download.
2. Download the no-CD patch that matches your game version.
3. Extract the no-CD patch file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
4. Copy the no-CD patch file to the game directory where the game executable (CM0001.EXE) is located.
5. Run the no-CD patch file and follow the instructions.
6. Play the game without CD.

Another way to play Championship Manager 00/01 without CD is to use a virtual drive program that creates a virtual CD-ROM on your PC. A virtual drive program can mount an image file of the game disc as if it was a real CD inserted in your PC. This way, you can play the game without having to use the physical disc. Some examples of virtual drive programs are DAEMON Tools Lite or PowerISO. To use a virtual drive program, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install the game from the original CD or a digital download.
2. Create an image file of the game disc using a program like ImgBurn or Alcohol 120%. An image file is a single file that contains all the data of the disc. The image file should have an extension like .ISO, .BIN, .CUE, etc.
3. Download and install a virtual drive program on your PC.
4. Run the virtual drive program and create a virtual drive on your PC.
5. Mount the image file of the game disc on the virtual drive using the virtual drive program.
