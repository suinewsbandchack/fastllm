Process Lasso Pro 9.1.0.68 Final x64 activator has many features that can help you customize and optimize your processes according to your needs and preferences. Some of these features are:
 
- **ProBalance**: This is the core feature of Process Lasso Pro 9.1.0.68 Final x64 activator, which dynamically adjusts the priority of running processes to maintain system responsiveness during high CPU loads. ProBalance can prevent lags, freezes, and delays caused by CPU-hungry processes.
- **CPU Affinities**: This feature allows you to set persistent CPU affinities for your processes, which means you can assign them to run on specific CPU cores every time they launch. This can help you balance the load among your CPU cores and improve the performance of certain applications.
- **CPU Sets**: This is a softer form of CPU affinities, which allows you to specify preferred CPU cores for your processes, rather than forcing them to run on specific cores. This can give you more flexibility and compatibility with other applications and system functions.
- **Priority Classes**: This feature allows you to set persistent priority classes for your processes, which means you can determine how much CPU time they get relative to other processes. You can choose from six priority classes, ranging from idle to real-time.
- **Disallowed Processes**: This feature allows you to block certain processes from running on your system, either by name or by criteria. You can use this feature to prevent unwanted or malicious applications from launching or consuming resources.
- **Limit Instances**: This feature allows you to limit the number of instances of a process that can run in a user session. You can use this feature to prevent multiple copies of the same application from opening and wasting resources.
- **Instance Balancer**: This feature allows you to spread CPU cores among running instances of an application, rather than letting them all run on the same core. You can use this feature to improve the performance and responsiveness of multi-instance applications.
- **CPU Limiter**: This feature allows you to dynamically and temporarily limit the CPU utilization of a process when it reaches a certain threshold. You can use this feature to prevent a process from hogging all the CPU resources and affecting other processes.
- **Group Extender**: This feature allows you to enable processor group unaware applications to make full use of the CPU. You can use this feature to overcome the limitations of some legacy applications that cannot access more than 64 logical processors.
- **Power Profile Automation**: This feature allows you to automatically switch power plans based on various triggers, such as idle time, process activity, manual timer, etc. You can use this feature to save energy when your PC is not in use, or boost performance when you need it.
- **Prevent Sleep (Keep Awake)**: This feature allows you to prevent your PC from sleeping for a specified amount of time, or when select processes are running. You can use this feature to keep your PC awake for important tasks or downloads.
- **Disable Hyper-Threading or SMT**: This feature allows you to dynamically disable Hyper-Threading or SMT on a per-process basis. You can use this feature to improve the performance of some applications that do not benefit from multiple threads per core.
- **Advanced Watchdog Rules**: This feature allows you to create advanced rules to perform a specified action when matched processes reach a certain threshold of resource consumption or other criteria. You can use this feature to automate various tasks or alerts based on process behavior.
- **Multi-select Operations**: This feature allows you to perform an operation like terminate on multiple processes at once. You can use this feature to quickly manage multiple processes with a single click.
- **Configuration Profiles**: This feature allows you to create and use multiple rule configurations for different scenarios or purposes. You can use this feature to switch between different settings easily and conveniently.

Process Lasso Pro 9.1.0.68 Final x64 activator is a comprehensive and versatile software that can help you take control of your processes and optimize your CPU performance. It has many features that can suit your needs
