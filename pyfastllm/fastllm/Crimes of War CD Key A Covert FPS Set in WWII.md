If you have purchased the game and want to install it on your PC, you will need a CD key. A CD key is a unique code that is used to verify your ownership of the game and prevent piracy. Without a CD key, you will not be able to play the game.
 
So where can you find your Crimes of War CD key? There are two possible ways:
 
1. Check the back of the CD case or the documentation that came with your game. The CD key should be printed on a sticker or a card that has a mix of numbers and letters separated by dashes. It should be around 20 characters long.
2. Contact customer service at City Interactive, the publisher of the game. You will need to provide proof of purchase, such as your original receipt, bar code on the package, or some other form of identification. They will then give you a new CD key if necessary.

Once you have your CD key, you can enter it during the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions and type in your CD key when prompted. The installation will then continue and you will be able to play the game.
 
However, you should be careful not to lose your CD key or share it with anyone else. If you do, you may not be able to play the game again or access the online features. You should also avoid using any illegal methods to obtain a CD key, such as downloading pirated software, using serial numbers that you did not purchase, or using key generators or cracks. These are not only unethical but also illegal and may result in legal consequences or damage to your computer.

## Crimes of War Review: A Mediocre Shooter with a Controversial Theme
 
Crimes of War is not a game that will impress you with its originality, quality, or sensitivity. The game is a mediocre shooter that borrows heavily from other games in the genre, such as Wolfenstein, Call of Duty, and Max Payne. The game also has a controversial theme that deals with Nazi experiments and atrocities during World War II, which may offend some players or make them uncomfortable.
 
The game's story follows two American soldiers who are sent on a covert mission to stop the Nazis from creating a new breed of super-soldiers using a mysterious substance called T9. Along the way, they discover horrific scenes of torture, mutilation, and death, as well as face off against hordes of enemies, including zombies, mutants, and robots. The game tries to create a dark and gritty atmosphere, but it often falls flat due to its poor graphics, voice acting, and writing.
 
The game's gameplay is also nothing to write home about. The game is a linear and scripted shooter that offers little challenge or variety. The game's main gimmick is the ability to use two special powers: the Time Shield and the Berserker mode. The Time Shield allows you to slow down time and deflect bullets, while the Berserker mode lets you go into a frenzy and slash enemies with your knife. These powers are supposed to add some strategy and fun to the combat, but they are often unnecessary or overpowered.
 
The game's multiplayer mode is also disappointing. The game supports up to 16 players online in three modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and ÃberMesser Deathmatch. The latter mode is the only one that stands out, as it forces players to use only their knives. However, the multiplayer mode suffers from lag, bugs, and a lack of maps and options.
 
Crimes of War is a game that tries to be edgy and provocative, but ends up being bland and forgettable. The game has nothing new or exciting to offer to fans of shooters or World War II games. The game also has a questionable taste and tone that may turn off some players or critics. Crimes of War is a game that you can easily skip or ignore.
