The default location for Generals Zero Hour is C:\Program Files\EA Games\Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour\ (or C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour\ if you have a 64-bit system). However, if you have installed the game in a different location or drive, you need to find it yourself.
