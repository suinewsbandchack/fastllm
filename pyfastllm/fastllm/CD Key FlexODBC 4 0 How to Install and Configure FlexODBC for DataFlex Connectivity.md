## Installing and Activating FlexODBC 4.0
 
To install FlexODBC 4.0, you need to download the setup file from the official website: [https://www.dataaccess.com/products/flexodbc/flexodbc.htm](https://www.dataaccess.com/products/flexodbc/flexodbc.htm). You can choose between the 32-bit or the 64-bit version, depending on your system architecture.
 
After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose a destination folder, and select the components to install. You can also choose to install the FlexODBC Administrator, which is a graphical user interface for managing your data sources.
 
Once the installation is complete, you will need to activate FlexODBC 4.0 with a valid CD key. A CD key is a 16-digit code that you can purchase from Data Access or from an authorized reseller. You can also request a free evaluation CD key from the website.
 
To activate FlexODBC 4.0, you need to run the FlexODBC Activation Wizard, which you can find in the Start menu or in the installation folder. You will need to enter your CD key, your software ID (which is generated automatically by the wizard), and your request code (which is also generated by the wizard). The wizard will then connect to the activation server and provide you with an activation code, which you need to enter in the wizard to complete the activation process.

## Configuring a Data Source for DataFlex Files
 
A data source is a set of parameters that defines how to connect to a specific database or file. To use FlexODBC 4.0 with your DataFlex files, you need to create a data source that specifies the location of your files, the driver name, and other options.
 
To create a data source, you can use either the FlexODBC Administrator or the ODBC Data Source Administrator, which are both available in the Control Panel or in the Start menu. The FlexODBC Administrator has more features and options than the ODBC Data Source Administrator, but both can be used to create and manage data sources.
 
In either tool, you need to choose whether to create a user data source or a system data source. A user data source is only available for the current user account, while a system data source is available for all users on the computer. You also need to choose a name and a description for your data source.
 
After creating a data source, you need to configure it by selecting FlexODBC as the driver name and clicking on Configure. You will then see a dialog box where you can specify various settings for your data source:
 
- Data Path: This is where you specify the folder where your DataFlex files are located. You can browse for it or type it manually.
- Data Dictionary: This is where you specify the name of your DataFlex data dictionary file, which contains information about your tables and fields. You can browse for it or type it manually.
- Options: This is where you can set various options for your data source, such as whether to use transactions, whether to enable logging, whether to use Unicode or ANSI characters, and more.
- Advanced: This is where you can set advanced options for your data source, such as whether to use SQL syntax or DataFlex syntax, whether to use aliases or real names for tables and fields, whether to enable caching, and more.

After configuring your data source, click on OK
