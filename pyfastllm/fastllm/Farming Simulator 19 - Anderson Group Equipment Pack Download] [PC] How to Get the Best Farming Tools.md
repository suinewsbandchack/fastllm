One of the main features of the Anderson Group Equipment Pack is the ability to create and handle silage bales. Silage bales are bales of grass or hay that have been fermented and stored in airtight conditions. They can be used as animal feed or as a source of renewable energy. To create silage bales, you need to use a bale wrapper, such as the Anderson RBMPRO 2000 or the Anderson RB580. These machines can wrap bales of different sizes and shapes with plastic film, creating a sealed environment that allows the fermentation process to take place.
 
Another feature of the DLC is the ability to create and handle bio-bales. Bio-bales are bales of straw or hay that have been treated with a special additive that makes them more resistant to fire and decay. They can be used as bedding for animals or as a fuel for biomass power plants. To create bio-bales, you need to use a bio-baler, such as the Anderson BIOBALER WB-55. This machine can harvest and bale various types of crops, such as grass, wheat, barley, and canola. It also injects the additive into the bales, making them more durable and eco-friendly.
 
The DLC also includes several implements that can help you collect, transport, and store your bales more easily. For example, you can use the Anderson HYBRID X XTRACTOR or the Anderson A950 to collect multiple bales at once and stack them on a trailer. You can also use the Anderson M160 or the Anderson PRO-CHOP 150 to chop your bales into smaller pieces and load them into a forage wagon or a mixer wagon. Finally, you can use the Anderson STACKPRO7200 or the Anderson TSR3450 to store your bales in neat stacks on your farm.
